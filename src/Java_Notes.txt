Core Java notes
Q What is Computer
-> A computer is a device or machine that performs processes, calculations and operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q What is language
-> language is the medium of the communication
-> every language has set of rules, grammar rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q What is programming
-> programming is nothing but set of instructions given to the computer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q What is binary language [0,1]
-> it is present in 0s and 1s form
-> it is understood by operating system
-> in binary language we write the code in 0s and 1s from but problem is that if we write 0s place 1s and 1s place 0s logic will be change
-> if any error come inside the program then it is difficult to find that because everything in 0s and 1s form
-> for small application we have to write number of lines code

Q what is assembly language
-> in assembly language we write code in english like words which is called mnemonics
        example. ADD NUM1,NUM2
-> but problem is that with this language it not directly understood by operating system because operating system knows only binary language,
   so we need assembler or translator to translate this language into binary language

Q what is high level programming language
-> this language is easy to understand by any developer so it is called HLPL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q What is software and their types
-> it is a set of instruction to perform specific task
    # Types of software are System software and Application software
    -> System software is designed to run computers hardware and provide a platform to run the applications
            eg. Windows, linux
    -> Application software is designed for end user to perform specific task
            eg. notepad, word
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q Introduction of the java
-> james gosling is father of the java
-> originally java developed by sun micro-system in 1991 and first version release in 1995
-> initial name of the java is OAK
-> there are no abbreviation ( short name) of java
-> slogan of the java is WORA (write once run anywhere)
-> currently java 19 version was release on sep 2022, every march and sep new java version is release
-> currently we are using java 8 and java 11 version in the companies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q goal behind making java
        or
 why java is the 1st choice of any programmer
-> WORA
-> less execution time
-> less number of instruction
-> less memory consumption
-> less power consumption
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q What is java
-> java is the class based object-oriented high level programming language
        # object-oriented because we can write everything inside the class and object
        # high level programming language because it is easy to understand for java developers
-> by using java we can develop application software like standalone application, web application, enterprise application
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q java feature
1) Simple
-> complex syntax which are present inside the c, c++ are removed just like friend function, explicit pointers, operator overloading

2) platform independent
-> In java we can write the code only once then java compiler convert that code in byte code or intermediate code after that jvm take byte code as an input and
   convert it into machine language. JVM is different for every operating system means jvm is platform dependent

-> app.java --> javac --> app.class --> jvm (for windows)--> binary/machine language
                          app.class --> jvm (for mac)--> binary/machine language
                          app.class --> jvm (for linux)--> binary/machine language

    # platform => it is an environment which let you execute the software
        eg. highway => road provide the environment to run the vehicles
        -> platform can be both software (os) and hardware (laptop)

    # platform independency => we can write code only once and run that code on any machine / operating system
    # platform dependency => write code on particular machine and run that code on that particular machine in which we write the code

    Q why c language are platform dependent
    -> in c we write code every time on particular machine and c compiler direct convert that code into machine language
    -> App.c --> c compiler --> binary/machine language (for windows)
       App.c --> c compiler --> binary/machine language (for mac)
       App.c --> c compiler --> binary/machine language (for linux)

3) Secure
-> in java for developer does not have direct memory access it means pointer does not support in java (internally pointer support by jvm)
-> there are some access specifiers are available in java that restrict the direct access in the code
-> security manager packages also available in java that does authentication and authorisation both

4) Robust
-> there is strong exception and error management is done with the help of exception handler
-> Memory management is also handled in efficient way
-> garbage collector is the program which remove the unreferenced or unused memory

5) Object-Oriented
-> in java we can write everything in the term of object and class

6) Multithreaded
-> multi - multiple
    thread - block of code
    multiple block of code run at a same time is called multithreading
-> parallel execution of the code is possible in java

7) high in performance
-> java support multithreading and JIT (just in time compiler) present inside the java
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q Java 8 features
-> functional interface (interface which contain single abstract method)
-> default methods in interface (method created inside the interface with default keyword and which has implementation)
-> static methods in interface
-> lambda expression (it is expression which is used to implement the functional interface)
-> method reference (it is used to replace a single method of the lambda expression)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q Java 7 features
-> strings in switch statement
-> the try with resources
-> caching multiple exceptions by single catch
-> binary literals (it is a number that is represented in 0s and 1s)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Types of the java application
-> by using java we can develop or there are three types of application in java standalone application, web application, enterprise application
    # Standalone application =>
    -> standalone application are also called as desktop application
    -> the application which are run on the operating system without internet is called standalone application
    -> We can develop standalone application by using JSE ( java standard edition => core java) + AWT /Swing or Javafx
    -> Example. notepad,word

    # web application =>
    ->  the application which are run at web server by using internet user can access this application is called web application
    ->  we can develop web application by using JEE ( java enterprise edition => advance java)+JDBC /Servlet/JSP/Spring MVC
    ->  Example. fb,youtube,email

     # Enterprise application =>
    ->  The application which are developed for corporate sides by using internet user can access this application is called enterprise application
    ->  we can develop enterprise application by using JSE ( java standard edition => core java)+JEE ( java enterprise edition => advance java)+Spring framework web services
    ->  Example. fb,youtube,email
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q what is command prompt
-> it is a software by using this we give the command to operating system to perform specific task

Q what is path
-> it is an exact location where file is present

Q what is java path
-> it is the location of the java executable files

Q why we need java path and when
-> we need java path to tell the operating system where java executable file are present
-> we need java path When we execute the java program by using command prompt

Q how we can set java path
-> go to environment variable
-> then in system variable go inside the path and click on edit
-> then paste the complete path of jdk (C://Program files/ Java / JDK / bin)

Q Can we create an empty java file, compile & execute it?
   1. We can create the empty java file
   2. we can compile the empty java file but no .class file will be generated
   3. since there is no .class generated we cannot run that

Q Can we create an empty class, can we compile & execute it?
   1. We can create empty class
   2. We can compile empty class and .class file will be generated
   3. We cannot run that because main method is required to start the execution

Q Is the main method mandatory for compilation or for execution?
      1. we can compile the java file without main method
      2. but for execution main method is compulsory.

Q Is it mandatory that the java file name & class name should be the same?
      1. **No**
      2. we can have class name and java file name different but the condition is class should not be public

Q When should a Java file name and class name be the same?
      When a class defined as a public then java file name and class name must be same.

Q Why should java file name & public class name be the same?
      because we tell the jvm this is the entry point of the program

Q What is the entry point of java class execution?
      main method

Q In a single java file, how many classes can we define?
      1. We can write any number of classes in a single java file.
      2. But, in a single java file there can be only one public class.
     As a best practices, we should only one class in a single file.

Q If a java file has multiple classes, what is the java file name?
      1. if the java file contains one public class then file name must be same as of that public class.
      2. if the java filed does not contain any public class then java file name can be anything

Q In a single java file, how many public classes can we define?
      Only one

Q If a java source file has multiple classes, how many .class files are generated by the compiler?
      For every class, there will be separate .class file will be generated.

Q Can we compile multiple classes at a time?
      Yes.

Q Can we execute multiple classes at a time?
      No
